# DrugGEN - Docking
[Glide (Schrödinger Suite)](https://www.schrodinger.com/products/glide) is used to perform docking of AKT1 crystal structure [(4GV1)](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/4GV1) and [DrugGEN generated molecules](https://github.com/HUBioDataLab/DrugGEN/tree/main/results/generated_molecules). The docking results of the crystal structure and selected de novo molecule (MOL_01_027820) were visualized using [PyMOL](https://www.schrodinger.com/products/pymol) and saved as [PDB files] (https://github.com/HUBioDataLab/DrugGEN/tree/main/results/docking%20%26%20MD/Docking).
# DrugGEN - Molecular Dynamics
The simulation analyses were done with the Simulation Interactions Diagram module integrated in Maestro ([Desmond (Schrödinger Suite)](https://www.schrodinger.com/products/desmond)).
